## Main Project: Idle Washer ðŸ§º

### Problem Statement

>**tldr**: *Inconvenient for dorm residents to physically check if shared washing machine is available to use.*
```
Students living in UTM dorms use a shared set of washing machines to do their laundry. 

Often, the washing machines are located at the ground floor.

The students have only one way of knowing if a washing machine
- is idle & available to use, OR
- was busy & has finished running.

They have to go to the washing machine & manually see it for themselves. 

This is a hassle, especially if they live at higher floors OR far from (& near to) the washing machines.

Imagine having to walk back & forth between your room & the washing machine. Not once, but multiple times.

Doing laundry should be easier. Let's make the washing machines work for you, not against you.


```


### Our Solution
A full stack IOT application to automate the checking of if a washing machine is in use or idle, & relaying this info to our dashboard app for users to see.
