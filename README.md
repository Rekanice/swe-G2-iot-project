## Main Project: Idle  ðŸ§º

### Problem Statement
Students living in UTM dorms use a shared set of washing machine to do their laundry. 

They have only one way of knowing if a washing machine is 
- idle & available to use 
- busy & finished running

They have to go to the washing machine & manually see for themselves. 

This is a hassle especially if they live far from the washing machine or at higher floors. Imagine having to walk all the way back to your room, disappointed, after realising the washing machine in use. Even those living close to the washing machine are not free from this inconvenience.
